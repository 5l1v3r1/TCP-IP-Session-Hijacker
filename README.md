5. IDS / Firewalls will not be able understand or see it!

# How requests are handled?
1. Web requests are automatically handled by Perl modules.

# Payload
1. Currently, I have injected payload in data section specifically for TELNET sessions running in UNIX platforms
2. When successfully authenitcated as victim, it will automatically add haroon:hacker as user/pass for TELNET sessions
3. More paylaods for HTTP/ FTP/ POP3/ SMTP/ TELNET, can be added in data inject command section
